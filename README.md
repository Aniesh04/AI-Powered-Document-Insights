**DocQuery: Ask Questions About Your PDF Documents**
DocQuery is a Streamlit application that allows you to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content. It uses the power of large language models and vector embeddings to provide accurate and relevant answers based on the information in your documents.

**Features**
1) Upload Multiple PDF Documents: You can upload one or more PDF documents to the application.
2) Process PDF Content: The application processes the text content of your PDF documents and generates embeddings for efficient retrieval.
3) Ask Questions: Enter your questions in the provided text input, and the application will search through the document content to provide relevant answers.
4) Conversation History: The application keeps track of the conversation history, allowing you to follow the context of the questions and answers.
5) Chat-like Interface: The application displays the conversation history and responses in a chat-like interface for a smooth user experience.

**Technologies Used**
1) Python: The application is built using Python.
2) Streamlit: The user interface is developed using the Streamlit framework for building data-centric web applications.
3) LangChain: The application utilizes the LangChain library for building applications with large language models.
4) OpenAI: The application uses the OpenAI language model and embeddings for generating accurate and relevant responses.
5) FAISS: The application uses the FAISS vector store from LangChain for efficient storage and retrieval of document embeddings.
